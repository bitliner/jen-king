# jen-king
Jenkins 2.0

## Requirements

- [X] no pipelines (no need of them. bash scripts are enough to run a pipeline of commands)
- [X] no plugins (no need of them. OS have already everything that is needed)
- [WIP] node.js modules for launching and stopping tasks
- [ ] Http API for launching and stopping tasks
- [ ] UI for launching and stopping tasks
- [ ] UI for displaying log files, with updating view when new log entries are appended
- [ ] UI: launch tasks by a string (representing the command to launch)
- [ ] if it dies or restart, launched tasks are not impacted (they keep running)
- [ ] if it dies or restart, running tasks are still visible on the UI
- [ ] UI for managing (store, edit, launch) task templates
